How to contribute
=================

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to
help this project come to fruition.


Testing
-------

We have a handful of *Visual Studio Unit Tests*. Please write VS unit tests for
new code you create.


Submitting changes
------------------

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to
[soerenkornetzki/KornetzkiIT.Reflection.AssemblyInformation][1] with a clear
list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). Please follow our
coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one
feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine
for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


Coding conventions
------------------

Please configure your code editor or IDE to follow the [.editorconfig][2] file.

In a short summary:

* We indent using four spaces (soft tabs).
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and
  make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love
  doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the
  ride as smooth as possible.
